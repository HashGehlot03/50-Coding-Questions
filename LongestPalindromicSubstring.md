[Problem Statement](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-palindromic-substring/)

## Approach 1[Brute Force] :- In this, first we find all substrings (as same as subarrays) which takes O(N^2) time and then check substring for palindrome and keeping up with its length(as well as maximum).

```cpp
// Time Complexity - O(N^3)           Space Complexity - O(N)
```
